# Defect-Detection
We have applied CNN Ensemble with Rejection
to detect product defects. Our experimental results have
shown that these two CNN models can detect product
defects very accurately, especial when they are used as a
member of an ensemble. Among them, GoogLeNet can
make more accurate judgments and reduce the number of
rejections effectively.
